Goals
	- Generate examples of medium-level parameters to train the models
	- Create a framework for building and using models that can extract medium-level parameters from images
	- Explore the orthogonality of different generated image types

Tools
	- Keras: A python based high-level neural network API
	- Processing: A visual design tool used to generate the training images for this project
	
Methods
	Roundness and messyness were selected as examples of mid-level features that could demonstrate the feasability of extracting these features
	Multiple sets of images were created for each parameter, starting with the Round Rectangles set for roundness. Each set has images that have values of that parameter that range from 0 to 100. In the case of roundness, 100 is completely round, and 0 is completely not-round.
	
	Convolutional Neural Network architectures were created with Keras to test the viability of extracting these parameters
	Different network architectures were tested to decrease the resulting size and training complexity of the models. Overall the training time was cut in half without affecting the quality of the results.
	
	It is important to have a way to save a model and its results in order to reuse the model later on, so a lot of effort was put into creating a command-line user interface for saving and loading models and using them to predict or train values for sets of images.
